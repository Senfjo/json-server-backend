      "description": "://about blank is a formerly illegal, multi-room club by Ostkreuz S-Bahnhof in Friedrichshain. It's a short walk from Salon Zur Wilde Renate, and like that club, it's a lightly renovated re-purposed building with seemingly endless nooks and crannies. There are two main dance floors inside, and in the summer DJs play out in the garden (this is open in the winter too, often with a bonfire going).\n\nThe music policy is open-ended but mostly focused on house and techno, with occasional bass or disco nights. The overall atmosphere is gritty, and the parties often go well into the following afternoon or evening.",

      "description": "Sitting in a dusty lot on the border of Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain, Berghain is widely considered one of the world's best nightclubs. It has three dance floors: Berghain, a dark main room where most DJs play techno, Panorama Bar, an upstairs space that's more focused on house, and the Säule on ground floor, though the music policy in all rooms is very open-ended. (There's also a men's-only club on the first level called Lab.Oratory, the occasionally used Halle and a smaller club with a separate entrance called Kantine am Berghain.)\n\nA number of details give Berghain its cult appeal: its residents, which include Steffi, Tama Sumo, Marcel Dettmann and Ben Klock, its set lengths, which range from three hours to more than eight, and its decor, which is mostly metal and poured concrete, with 30 meter ceilings and seemingly endless nooks and crannies.\n\nMost of the parties are extremely long: Friday night events usually wrap up early Saturday afternoon, but Saturdays typically run well into Monday morning. Perhaps the most notorious aspect of the club is its door policy—hundreds of people are turned away each weekend, including regulars, often for reasons that are completely mysterious to everyone except the doormen.",

Then upstairs there is Grüner Raum where it’s all about house, and Roter Raum for all things slow, weird and trippy disco. The atmosphere is that of a theatrical house party. The booking is a mixture of international and local artists. A large outdoor courtyard is open during the summer, which provides another bar with food and plenty of space to hang out.",

The old walls open up a playground with a cultivated underground character and a powerful sound system. The furniture was deliberately kept industrial in order to emphasize the club as such and not distract from its original atmosphere. Two differently styled floors and a lounge offer sufficient creative space for a varied range of international, national and local artists and renowned event series. Here you can enjoy consistent electronic sound.",
