      "description": "://about blank is a formerly illegal, multi-room club by Ostkreuz S-Bahnhof in Friedrichshain. It's a short walk from Salon Zur Wilde Renate, and like that club, it's a lightly renovated re-purposed building with seemingly endless nooks and crannies. There are two main dance floors inside, and in the summer DJs play out in the garden (this is open in the winter too, often with a bonfire going).\n\nThe music policy is open-ended but mostly focused on house and techno, with occasional bass or disco nights. The overall atmosphere is gritty, and the parties often go well into the following afternoon or evening.",

      "description": "Sitting in a dusty lot on the border of Kreuzberg and Friedrichshain, Berghain is widely considered one of the world's best nightclubs. It has three dance floors: Berghain, a dark main room where most DJs play techno, Panorama Bar, an upstairs space that's more focused on house, and the Säule on ground floor, though the music policy in all rooms is very open-ended. (There's also a men's-only club on the first level called Lab.Oratory, the occasionally used Halle and a smaller club with a separate entrance called Kantine am Berghain.)\n\nA number of details give Berghain its cult appeal: its residents, which include Steffi, Tama Sumo, Marcel Dettmann and Ben Klock, its set lengths, which range from three hours to more than eight, and its decor, which is mostly metal and poured concrete, with 30 meter ceilings and seemingly endless nooks and crannies.\n\nMost of the parties are extremely long: Friday night events usually wrap up early Saturday afternoon, but Saturdays typically run well into Monday morning. Perhaps the most notorious aspect of the club is its door policy—hundreds of people are turned away each weekend, including regulars, often for reasons that are completely mysterious to everyone except the doormen.",

Those who like it quiet will prefer the green oasis created in the 19th century, while those who like to dance late into the night should visit the Humboldthain club.\n\nLocated in the Wedding district, the club is easy to reach thanks to its direct location next to the S-Bahn station and is certainly not the only reason why it is a popular venue for a cheerful, colorful crowd. Humboldthain offers a varied program with parties covering different music genres, but mainly with electronic roots.",
